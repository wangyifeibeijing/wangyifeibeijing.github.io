## Research Experience

```Residual Entropy-based GCN for Community Detection
- Classical community detection methods only utilize topology, without inherent structures of the features. GCN-based models rely on Auto Encoder or Ncut stages, which is not suitable for Community Detection.
- We designed a residual entropy to quantify structural information for community detection on attributed graphs, and combine it with GCN to find ideal solution.
- The model outperforms others. We are preparing the paper.
